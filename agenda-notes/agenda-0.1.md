# Meta-tx Community Call Agenda 0.1

Original: https://hackmd.io/WmHWgQDrSW6cgES9x2HXfw?edit

### Agenda:

- *Quick contextual introduction of this community call*

- *Introduction of today's agenda / tickets to talk about*

- Does anyone want to add anything else onto the agenda? 

- **Introduce everyone:** what they are working on. If they are working on meta-txs how much so far

---

- **Building decentralised network where to start?**

- Lead discussion, research and development first by MVP

- Gather requirements, schema designs of different teams (even just 3-6 teams is good)

- Identify an MVP (Harbour MVP trusted network of nodes that get TX, check then executes, no economics for now)

Service node...

1. Checks if executable
2. Checks if execution conditions are met
3. Checks if tx is economically viable

- ***Define the requirements, share schema designs, needs of different parties***

Harbour MVP Design?
