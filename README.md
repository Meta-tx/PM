# Project Command Room

**Goal:** 

- Create a decentralised p2p network of service node servers that recieve and execute meta-txs / meta-transactions.
- This solution is known as the Layer 2 Tesla Network

**Reasons for p2p decentralisation**
- Censorship resiliency, meta-txs enable users to execute onchain transactions without gas. This depends on a service node to relay the transaction. If this server goes down, users will lose access of the ability to send transactions.
- Less effort for individual teams that want to use meta-txs since it will be a decentralised project that develops by itself

**Project overview**

This project currently contains two repositories.

- [Welcome guide](https://github.com/Meta-tx/Harbour-MVP/wiki) Go here if you are a meta-tx noob

- [PM](https://github.com/Meta-tx/PM) (Project management): This is where the operational and logistical side of the project is handled. All meeting agenda, notes and scheduling + organisational items of interest will be handled here.

- [Harbour MVP](https://github.com/Meta-tx/Harbour-MVP): We are currently working on an MVP version of this decentralised meta-tx network. All discussions, code and related work surrounding the MVP will take place on this repository.

- [Harbour MVP Wiki](https://github.com/Meta-tx/Harbour-MVP/wiki): This is where all technical as well as educational documentation will be kept. 

**Communication & Coordination**

We currently use telegram to coordinate as a live chat feed. For all meetings / calls that will be announced, they will also be posted up into this PM repository as an open issue. To join the telegram, we invite you to find the link ~ it should be around in one of our agendas :)
